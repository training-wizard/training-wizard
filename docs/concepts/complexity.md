# Managing Complexity in Model Training

## The Problem

The complexity of training language models, especially during the prototype stage, can be a daunting task. Altering one element often has a cascading effect on others, which can lead to unmaintainable codebases and overly complicated workflows.

## The Solution

We take a page from the software engineer's handbook to handle this complexity through **strategic layers of abstraction**. By abstracting away details at different levels, individuals working on a project can focus on their specific area without being overwhelmed by the entire system.
