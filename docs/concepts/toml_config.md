# TOML Configs

The Training Wizard uses TOML files to define **configuration** needed to run a training recipe (= training [spec](spec.md)). 

This is called the "training recipe specification" of a training run because it specifies exactly how the training run should perform. Example recipe specifications can be found in the `examples` folder.
